My thoughts on an 'ideal' world language.

It should:
- with the aid of a dictionary and a basic understanding of the grammar, be understandable by most people
- knowing the phonetics, be able to be pronounced easily or without much learning to most people
- have a proportional ease of understanding with the complexity of the topic
- be somewhat pleasing to speak and hear (although this is largely subjective)
- make use of compound words
- make use of synonyms for ideas that are similar but more complex? (TBD) [or perhaps compounds for specifity]

It shouldn't:
- compromise on its ability to represent complex ideas and thoughts
- isolate those who fit into the current social norm
- use words only known to certain language families in order to be recognisable to some
- omit sounds and features only a small number of languages find difficult to make use of
- use heavily conjugated words
- have more than one (max. 2) meanings per word
